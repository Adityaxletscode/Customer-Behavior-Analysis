# üß† Customer Behavior Analysis  

## üìã Overview  
The **Customer Behavior Analysis** project aims to understand how customer demographics, product categories, seasons, and discounts affect shopping behavior and spending patterns.  

This end-to-end data analytics project integrates **Python (EDA + data cleaning)**, **PostgreSQL (business analysis via SQL queries)**, and **Power BI (dashboard visualization)** to uncover insights that can help optimize marketing, pricing, and customer retention strategies.

---

## üìÅ Dataset  
- **File Name:** `customer_shopping_behavior.csv`  
- **Records:** 3,900+ customer transactions  
- **Attributes:** 18 columns, including:
  - `Customer ID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Category`, `Item Purchased`  
  - `Purchase Amount (USD)`, `Season`, `Discount Applied`, `Promo Code Used`  
  - `Subscription Status`, `Payment Method`, `Previous Purchases`  

### üéØ Objective  
To analyze how **different customer segments behave**, and identify factors that **influence revenue, loyalty, and purchase frequency**.

## üîç Project Workflow  

### 1. **Data Loading & Cleaning (Python)**
- Loaded dataset using Pandas and checked data quality.  
- Handled missing values, standardized column names, and converted data types.  
- Removed outliers in purchase amount and encoded categorical values where required.  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Key analyses performed:
- Purchase trends by **gender**, **season**, and **category**.  
- Correlation between **age**, **previous purchases**, and **spending**.  
- Impact of **discounts and promo codes** on purchase amount.  
- Visualized findings using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** (heatmaps, bar charts, pie charts).

## üßÆ SQL Business Analysis (PostgreSQL)  

The cleaned dataset was imported into a **PostgreSQL** database for deeper **business insights**. Below are some key SQL analyses included in the project:

### üî∏ 1. Revenue by Gender
```sql
SELECT gender, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM customer
GROUP BY gender;
```
‚û° Shows total revenue generated by male vs female customers.

### üî∏ 2. Discount vs High Spenders
```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM customer
WHERE discount_applied='Yes'
AND purchase_amount > (SELECT AVG(purchase_amount) FROM customer);
```
‚û° Identifies customers who used a discount but still spent above average.

### üî∏ 3. Top 5 Products by Review Rating
```sql
SELECT item_purchased, ROUND(AVG(review_rating::numeric),2) AS average_rating
FROM customer
GROUP BY item_purchased
ORDER BY average_rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
‚û° Highlights products with the best customer feedback.

### üî∏ 4. Subscriber Spending Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
CASE WHEN subscription_status='Yes' THEN 'subscribers'
     WHEN subscription_status='No' THEN 'non-subscribers'
END AS status,
COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers,
ROUND(AVG(purchase_amount),2) AS average_revenue,
SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM customer
GROUP BY status;
```
‚û° Compares average and total spending between subscribers and non-subscribers.

### üî∏ 5. Customer Segmentation
```sql
SELECT
CASE
  WHEN previous_purchases=1 THEN 'New'
  WHEN previous_purchases BETWEEN 2 AND 10 THEN 'Returning'
  ELSE 'Loyal'
END AS customer_segment,
COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customer
GROUP BY customer_segment;
```
‚û° Segments customers into **New**, **Returning**, and **Loyal** groups based on their purchase history.

## üìä Power BI Dashboard  
The Power BI dashboard provides a **visual summary** of all insights found through Python and SQL analysis.  

### Key Visuals:
- **Revenue by Gender and Age Group**  
- **Top Performing Categories and Products**  
- **Subscription vs Non-Subscription Spending**  
- **Sales Trends by Season**  
- **Payment Method Preferences**

## ‚úÖ Results & Insights  
- **Women customers** contributed higher total revenue, especially in **Clothing** and **Footwear**.  
- **Spring and Winter** seasons showed strong sales performance.  
- Customers with **active subscriptions** and **discount usage** had higher repeat purchase rates.  
- **Loyal customers** (previous purchases >10) contributed significantly to overall revenue.  
- **Credit Card** and **PayPal** dominated payment preferences.
